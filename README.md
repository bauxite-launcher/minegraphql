# minegraphql

A GraphQL API for Minecraft versions and more

## Motivations

I wanted to play with Apollo Server some more, so here I am.

## Installation

- TODO once project is started

## Features

**Disclaimer**: This is a _personal_ project ─ despite being open-source (and open to pull requests) ─ I'm the only target end user. In other words, I'm building this for fun; it is not a production-grade application and should not be used as such. Furthermore, it should be noted that both Minecraft Forge and CurseForge use in-page advertising, which this project is not intending to circumvent.

- [x] Basic Heroku-ready GraphQL server boilerplate
- [x] Basic Minecraft version lookup
- [ ] Minecraft version manifest lookup
- [ ] [Minecraft Forge][forge] version lookup
- [ ] [CurseForge][curseforge] project lookup (possibly using [CitricSquid's amazing API][cfwidgets])
